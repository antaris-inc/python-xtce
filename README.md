# python-xtce

This library supports dynamic encoding and decoding of messages using XTCE. 

The current target XTCE version is 1.2

The library does not yet support the entire scope of XTCE.
The initial goal is to focus on the subset of XTCE employed by the basic examples provided in the CCSDS publications (vendored in ./xtce/examples).
This goal has not yet been reached, and many XTCE elements are either not implemented at all or partially implemented.
